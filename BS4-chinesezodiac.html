            <h2 class="text-uppercase">dog</h2>           
            <p class="lead text-justify"><strong>
                If you’re a Dog native, this is your year! Your sign is primed and ready to take advantage of some amazing energy during the next 12 months.
                The year of the earth Dog highlights dependability, building loyalty at work and in relationships, and certainly building material wealth.
                The solar eclipse of February 15 sets the scene, bringing your attention to the relationships nearest and dearest to you. It’s a great time for family reunions, and getting the old gang together again, to swap treasured stories. You have so much going for you now that it’s hard to make a wrong move. Enjoy the fruits of your labor!</strong></p>

            <h2 class="text-uppercase">pig</h2>            
            <p class="lead text-justify"><strong>
    Pig natives love to be the reliable one in the family or group of friends, and this year is no different. You’re often the focal point at gatherings, or the one everyone turns to in times of strife.
    But during the year of the earth Dog, you’re also able to feel a little calmer and more centered in your own life, even if the world seems a little crazy outside.
    Love and money enjoy small, meaningful shifts, but it’s your friends and family who remain devoted. Community, too, is an important facet of this year, and gives back to you immensely.

            <h2 class="text-uppercase">rat</h2>           
            <p class="lead text-justify"><strong>
    Usually, you don’t let things bother you, Rat. You’re too busy having a great time and making your goals come true. You’re driven like that.
    But during the year of the earth Dog, you may find that you’re more determined than ever to make some of your larger goals happen. You’ve put all the smaller steps into place, and now it’s time to reap the rewards of all your hard work.
    Just as you know how to work hard, though, you also know how to play hard. Planning a once-in-a-lifetime vacation lets you blow off steam and celebrate the fruits of your labor.

            <h2 class="text-uppercase">ox</h2>            
            <p class="lead text-justify"><strong>
    Your sign of the Ox is one of the more dependable. Like the Dog, you share a need to be appreciated.
    During the year of the earth Dog, your friends, family, and mates find so many ways to show their affection, particularly around the solar eclipse of July 12. Your desire to build more good fortune in your life grows by leaps and bounds as you get to know the right people, and put the right plans into place.
    Though plans can sometimes go awry, you’re not afraid to look silly once in a while, as long as you get where you want to be.

            <h2 class="text-uppercase">tiger</h2>
            <p class="lead text-justify"><strong>
    During the year of the earth Dog, the Tiger may feel like life is going by in slow motion. You prefer things to be bigger, bolder, and more exciting.
    But this year comes with such joy and positive life lessons. You learn to relax a little, and open up to new people. You also learn how to let others take charge, even when you were born to lead.
    The energy of the Dog teaches you to chill out a little more, let go of your famous temper, and enjoy life a little more. Friends, family, and mates become front and center as you have fun with relationships.

            <img src="images/rabbit.png" class="img-fluid mx-auto d-block" alt="rabbit" />
            <h2 class="text-uppercase">rabbit</h2>
            <p class="lead text-justify"><strong>
    Your sign of the Rabbit is the best match for the Dog, and the two of you get along famously. During the year of the earth Dog, every aspect of your life stands to benefit. The solar eclipse of July 12 acts like a launch pad to put your goals and dreams into the Universe.
    From new relationships to progress at work and in your personal life, it’s a great year to build stability. Even your financial situation gets a boost from the earth element, and you can see your funds grow through careful decision-making. Let a little of your normal reserve go, and have fun this year!
</strong></p>

            <img src="images/dragon.png" class="img-fluid mx-auto d-block" alt="dragon" />
            <h2 class="text-uppercase">dragon</h2>
            <p class="lead text-justify"><strong>
    Since your sign of the Dragon and the Dog don’t normally get along, this may be a year of adjustments for you.
    You just want things faster and more dynamically than the slower energy the Dog can provide. But if you use your energy to learn new skills such as patience, compassion, and self-care, you’ll rise to the top, the way you always do.
    Your health especially needs attention around the solar eclipse of July 12, when it’s easy to burn out from too much work, and not enough play. Try to build some healthy “you” time away from it all, to rest and recharge.

            <h2 class="text-uppercase">snake</h2>
            <p class="lead text-justify"><strong>
    Everyone knows what a charmer you are, and this goes double during the year of the earth Dog. You set up the year by making strong intentions, and even visualizing what you want. From that point forward, watch out!
    When you get together with the Dog, you both benefit. Partnerships are highlighted around the solar eclipse of August 11, and you may find that it’s tough to keep a new relationship under wraps anymore.
    Why bother? You’re happier when you’re together, anyway. Self-improver though you are, you’re also mastering new skills like resilience, courage and renewed energy. Just make sure you get your beauty sleep each night!

            <h2 class="text-uppercase">horse</h2>
            <p class="lead text-justify"><strong>
    Your sign of the Horse gets along very well with Dogs, so under the year of the earth Dog, you’re poised to make tons of progress across all areas of your life!
    Your dependability is legendary, but if a friend has been taking advantage, it’s time to have a gentle yet firm talk about boundaries around the lunar eclipse of July 27. You can only pick someone up so many times before it gets old.
    Luckily, your personal goals, like better health and wellbeing, not to mention fitness, are getting a boost come early spring. You’re hard to beat when you apply your energy.

            <h2 class="text-uppercase">goat</h2>
            <p class="lead text-justify"><strong>
    Though you try to get along with everyone you meet, blending in with the crowd, the Goat and the Dog aren’t the greatest mix of energies.
    Hence, the year of the earth Dog may take some getting used to. Your native creativity will be on full display this year, as you make new opportunities for yourself in and out of the workplace.
    Relationships soar around mid-year, when you finally can’t hold your feelings in anymore. Thankfully, they’re returned, and the sky’s the limit! Friends, family, and other loyal cohorts pick you up when things are challenging, and get you back on your feet.

            <h2 class="text-uppercase">monkey</h2>
            <p class="lead text-justify"><strong>
    Monkey natives like you are used to getting their own way in life. But during the year of the earth Dog, some of your challenges may revolve around having to form alliances with people you’d prefer to avoid.
    At work, you shine when you become a true team player, while in love, dropping your guard ever so slightly elevates you both. Your natural creativity shines during the winter months, when you could find that someone wants to pay you for your talents.
    The adventures you have may be somewhat calmer than in other years, but ultimately much more rewarding. Friends and relatives are more important than ever.

            <h2 class="text-uppercase">rooster</h2>
            <p class="lead text-justify"><strong>
    Your sign of the Rooster is a funny one, not used to taking displeasure lightly. But during the year of the earth Dog, it’s not about you, and you may need some time to readjust.
    Though you get ahead in money and at work through steady application of your skills, you may be forced into uncomfortable situations with people you don’t like.
    However, being a team player means impressing the higher-ups, and getting better assignments down the line. Prove your worth in romance, too, by showing your partner all you bring to the table. Those looking for new love score around summer’s end.
